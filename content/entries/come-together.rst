I have cleaned out all of my old files from my code-related domain and put
them up on my Github. Only two things were really still relevant.

The Tiger Python module is on my Github, as a brand-new project, tiger_. It
was broken, but I fixed it to work again and added a few tests as well. I even
tagged version 0.2 as tiger-0.2 in the repository.

The Compiz wallpaper script, for assigning files to the wallpapers in compiz,
is also alive and well. I did not test it since I do not have a Compiz setup
at the moment, but I think that it still works as well as it did before, which
of course is to say "not at all." At any rate, it is in my madsnippets_
repository.

With these changes, code.corbinsimpson.com is ready to be retired, so I am
taking it offline. Nobody will be affected. Thank you for your patience.
