I recently purchased and installed a standing desk. While I normally don't
blog about things in my personal life, I figured that this was permissible
since it directly affects my ability to write code.

This standing desk is a `Fredrik`_ "computer work station," but let's be
honest, here: it's a standing desk. It's pretty sturdy and removes the need to
hack together various Ikea desks to produce reasonably-scaled tabletops.
Pictured here is my desk, in its natural habitat. My workstation and
hacked-apart AGP box both have their own monitor, and there is plenty of
tabletop room for anything I need to have at my hands.

For those in the audience who aren't yet aware of standing desks, and don't
want to read `Wikipedia on standing desks`_, here are the abridged notes:

 * **Pros**

   * Reduces back stress and pain after a few months
   * Reduces risk of `DVT`_
   * When monitors are elevated, reduces neck stress and pain

 * **Cons**

   * Slightly more expensive than sitting desks
   * Hard to find
   * Causes foot and ankle stress for the first few weeks
   * Turns one into a hipster programmer

So, on the bright side, this desk has definitely improved my back pain. But,
if I start writing `Node.js`_ code soon, we'll all know who to blame.
