Things have changed a bit around here, and hopefully for the better. I've
replaced my old Drupal stack with a fairly slimmed-down piece of code based on
the terrific Bottle framework. Over the next few weeks, I will try to talk a
lot more about the stuff I've been working on, including code, music, and
other things.

Hopefully this site is a lot easier to look at than the old site. Feel free to
drop me a line if you find any problems!
