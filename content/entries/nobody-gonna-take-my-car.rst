Hi! Just a quick status update on that crazy Chromebook_ of mine.

To get VBA-M to work, use the GTK+ frontend by emerging with
``USE="gtk"``. Set it however you like; I highly advise against setting
it globally, but if you have sgt-puzzles installed, you will already have
GTK+. Afterwards, you will have a shiny new ``gvbam`` executable, ready
to use.

While ZSNES might be very unhappy, Snes9x_ can correctly accept input. Well,
to a point, at least; sound output and screen scaling appear to be broken.
More research is needed.
