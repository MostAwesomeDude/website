Hi! Just a quick status update on that crazy <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook">Chromebook</a> of mine.

To get VBA-M to work, use the GTK+ frontend by emerging with
<tt>USE="gtk"</tt>. Set it however you like; I highly advise against setting
it globally, but if you have sgt-puzzles installed, you will already have
GTK+. Afterwards, you will have a shiny new <tt>gvbam</tt> executable, ready
to use.

While ZSNES might be very unhappy, <a href="http://www.snes9x.com/">Snes9x</a>
can correctly accept input. Well, to a point, at least; sound output and
screen scaling appear to be broken. More research is needed.
