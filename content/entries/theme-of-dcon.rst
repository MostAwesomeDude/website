Some of you may remember the "Release Date: 2011" meme which we've been
spreading for the past two years. We are proud to announce an actual piece of
DCoN software, now available for your use.

Presenting <a href="https://github.com/MostAwesomeDude/dcon">DCoN</a>, the
Doubly-linked Comic ORM for Newrem. This is the new webcomic management system
powering <a href="http://newrem.com/">Newrem</a>. It's young, but already it's
powerful enough to fill the shoes it was designed to fill, and perhaps other
people will find it useful as well.

We are releasing DCoN under the GPLv2, in accordance with obligations laid out
by one of the component libraries. We hope it will be instructive for others
looking to create or deploy webcomic management systems.

Please note that this software is, as people often say in the business,
"brand-spankin'-new," so don't be surprised if there are still a few bugs left
to hammer out.
